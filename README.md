# Computer Vision Learning Journey 🎥👁️

Welcome to my learning repository! 🚀  
This repo documents my journey of exploring **Computer Vision** using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
I’ll be sharing code, notes, and experiments as I learn and practice through tutorials (especially from YouTube 📺).  

---

## 🔹 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in **Python + OpenCV**
- Explore basic image processing techniques
- Work on mini-projects like face detection, object tracking, and filters
- Share progress openly for others who might want to learn along the way

---

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy / Matplotlib** (for image processing & visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks (sometimes, for easier exploration)

## 🔹 Progress
- [x] Setting up the environment  
- [x] Learning image basics (reading, writing, resizing)  
- [ ] Applying filters and transformations  
- [ ] Face detection with Haar cascades  
- [ ] Object tracking  
- [ ] Mini projects
